# PivotTree_DoctOral

For feature extraction and respective feature dataframe creation, it is needed:

- `oral_datas/` folder including `./data/images/` which store oral lesion images
- `oral_datas/` folder which includes `train.json`,`test.json`,`val.json` files which include annotations information and reference to respective image

For the model assessment, a folder named `data` must be avilable containing the dataset containing feature emebedding from the Detectron2 architecture:

- `oral2_train_features.json`
- `oral2_test_features.json`
- `oral2_val_features.json`
